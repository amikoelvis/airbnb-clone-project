### Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Identifying design properties (such as colors, typography, and spacing) from a mockup is essential because:

- It **ensures visual consistency** across the entire application, providing users with a polished and professional experience.
- It helps in **building reusable components** that adhere to the design system.
- It allows the team to **implement the design accurately**, reducing miscommunication between designers and developers.
- It contributes to **maintaining brand identity** and enhances user trust in the platform.
- It speeds up development by giving developers a clear reference for UI decisions.

By documenting these properties early, teams can build more efficiently and ensure the final product aligns closely with the original design vision.
